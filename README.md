# TEK-80
TEK-80 keyboard case

This case is fully functional. However, I wouldn't call it good. I cannot recommend that anyone get this made without at least 2 adjustments :

1. It is way too tall at the front. You should change it to be 20mm at the most, otherwise it'll be very uncomfortable.
2. It is designed for the Phantom PCB. This PCB was made specifically to replace Filco PCBs, and as such it is NOT a good PCB for using in a fully custom keyboard. You should adapt this case to work with a B87, GON, or similar PCB.
